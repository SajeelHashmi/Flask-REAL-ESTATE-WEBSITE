# Property Rent/Purchase Site

This project is a demonstration of a Property Rent/Purchase Site built using Flask, a web framework in Python. It showcases various features and functionality to simulate a platform that connects property owners and tenants/buyers.

---

## Features

1. **Property Listings:** The project includes a database of properties available for rent or purchase. Each listing contains essential information such as property description, amenities, pricing, and contact details of the owner/agent.

2. **Search and Filters:** Users can search for properties based on location, property type, price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and more. The project provides a search functionality with filters to refine the search results.

3. **User Accounts:** Users can create accounts to access additional features. They can save their favorite listings, save search history, and receive email alerts for new properties that match their criteria.

4. **Property Submission:** Registered users can list their properties for potential customers to view.

5. **Email Alerts:** Users can choose to check alerts explicitly when logged in, or the system can automatically check at a specific time. To set the automatic check, the server needs to be configured to run the `emailAlerts.py` script at the dedicated time. This separation of email alerts ensures scalability as Flask is not an asynchronous framework.
